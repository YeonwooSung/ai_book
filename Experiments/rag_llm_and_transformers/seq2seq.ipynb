    "In the previous notebook, we looking into some tasks that a \"BERT-like\" encoder-only model was relatively well-equipped for. We saw first-hand the power of language modeling, but also noticed that there were some key restrictions - namely the per-token/per-passage reasoning limitations - that kept the model from being viable in some tasks. The zero-shot classification pipeline got around that by querying the encoder multiple times over to generate a value for each class. In this notebook, we'll extend this formulation to an architectural component that can generate ordered sequences in a similar fashion, and use it for generating unbounded responses. \n",

    "[**Machine Translation**](https://huggingface.co/tasks/translation) is a common term to describe... translating one language into another automatically using software. Yeah, it's not as rigorous of a term as you might be used to, but it's flashy and worth throwing out there because it is an extremely important task in this day and age! \n",

    "Previously, we learned that a BERT-like encoder architecture can be used to solve a simplified case of the problem when one of the following conditions is met:\n",
    "- The input and output sequence have the same number of entries, solvable via token prediction for each input token.\n",
    "- The output sequence is a subset of the input sequence, solvable via range prediction.\n",

    "You can also try to get creative with your formulations and can remove some of the hard limitations of this architecture, but those are still generally considered encoder-derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been throwing the term around a lot, **encoder**, but you might not have noticed why it's called that. Considering the logic of the autoencoder, you might have intuited *(reasonably but not quite correctly)* that the encoder body is only defined to be the task-generic series of transformer blocks and that the output is necessarily a latent encoding with no human-interpretable meaning. By this formalization, the classification head is the \"decoder\" that generates human-reasonable outputs.\n",

Reading through, you'll notice some recommendations and high-level overviews, but can also see that there is pipeline support for it! In fact, you don't even need to specify the back-end model if you don't want to: `transformers` will make a selection for you (though we'll do it anyways):"

Previously, we started with the classic English-to-French task which has some well-known nice datasets and has been a staple for the NLP community for a long time.

    "- The encoder is called once on the input to create a representation that can be used by the decoder. In most models, the encoder state is just computed once to provide a good context, and then is left as a static context to ground the decoder.\n",
    "    - This actually helps with stability during training by avoiding the \"moving target\" problem.\n",
    "- The decoder is asked to generate one token at a time, where the first token is generated from a starting token (in this case, `<pad>`). This first generation is conditioned entirely on the encoder output, whereas subsequent tokens are conditioned on both the original encoding and the generation history. As we saw earlier, the generation stops when the end-of-string token (i.e. `</s>`) is computed.\n",
    "    - You might also notice that the decoder only recieves one word at a time. Efficient implementations store the results computed at previous generations, since the key-value calculations from the previous generations can just be stored and incorporated in with the new results from each new token. You can see this in `past_key_values`, which stores the attention components from previous generations and gets progressively bigger as the generation progresses."

In fact, those stretch goals we had before for our `T5` model are actually quite rudamentary in comparison to what this model can actually do! This emergent behavior; being able to reason about the context itself and adapt to new tasks based on natural language alone, is known as **in-context learning**, and is the main enabler of the [**prompt engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) paradigm. \n",

    "- **Format Abiding:** Consider how the model was actually trained and what kinds of formats did the inputs usually take on. The closer the task is to something it had to do, the better it will perform. \n",
    "- **Few-Shot Prompting:** Models tend to favor repetition of patterns due to the nature of their training data, so maybe giving some examples is a good idea. This is known as one-shot or few-shot prompting, when you give one or several examples of good behavior at inference time and hope that the model will follow the pattern. \n",
    "- **Iterative Trial-And-Error:** If your model understands your instructions and is good about following it (i.e. with instruction fine-tuning), you can keep updating your prompt to correct the undesirable properties of your model's behavior. This process can look quite different on a per-model basis; some models are very good at following instructions, some are less good, and some will not be able to deviate from their training sufficiently for specific use cases.\n",
    "- **Priming:** In addition to giving \"instructions\", you can add an initial generation into your decoder to get it to continue from there. This is a great way of getting around default behavior (for better or for worse) but may not always be supported by default for encoder-decoder architectures. \n",

In the next section, we're going to see a use case for which encoder-decoders really shine; **multi-modal generation**. After that, we'll go into the kinds of tasks that might be better-suited for only the decoder; **text-generation**."
