    "\n",
    "Earlier, we discussed the Seq2Seq model and its ability to generate novel sequences autoregressively (via its decoder) from an input sequence provided as context (via its encoder). We also saw that it can be used for \"complete the response\" objectives with some success. However, as the field evolved, researchers found the encoder might be redundant for certain tasks that rely on the same vocabulary across both the encoder and decoder. Taking the \"continue the passage\" example, the passage itself can be directly fed into the decoder without needing an intermediate representation provided by the encoder.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Match the Intended Application:** The model creates the function or method that aligns well with the provided instructions.\n",

    "- **Include Decision Logic:** Many training examples include comments, and so the model might generate inline explanations or comments that offer insights into the logic it's using.\n",

    "However, while sometimes CodeGen follows instructions well, other times it might not:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overgenerate:** The model might provide more than what's required. For instance, after implementing the Fibonacci function, it might generate a runner main or even start another unrelated function, since many training examples exhibit such patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misinterpret Intent:** If the model hasn't seen certain specific instructions during its training, it might generate code that's related but not quite what you intended. For instance, when seeking an implementation of an image-based autoencoder, early versions of ChatGPT might offer a tutorial on an MNIST conv2d model. This model will have the same issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assume External Context:** The model might generate code that references or relies on external functions or variables that weren't defined in the prompt, assuming their existence based on its training data. While sometimes this can reflect good coding practices, it might leave gaps in standalone tasks.\n",

    "These are all hard issues that extend well beyond CodeGen-350M, and there's plenty of research out there with insights about how to tackle them. With more limited models, you will need to play around with settings a lot more to get them to function as you would like. With larger models, however, you can expect a more seamless default behavior. We won't load it in here (because it would strain your compute resources for a relatively quick investigation), but you can expect a lot more predictable behavior from the [`CodeGen 2.5 7B Mono`](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codegen25-7b-mono) configuration. Instead of trying to get the best possible continue-my-code predictions, let's investigate something a lot more general, a lot harder to get right, and a lot more useful for the average user!"

    "**Chat Models** are essentially dialog predictors; they take instructions on how to act, and then autoregressively predict responses to user questions while following the instructions. Intuitively, this makes sense as a premise and probably sounds reasonable enough to train for a specific task. However, the extension into **general chat** is a giant step up:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many popular flavors of text-gen LLMs with various performance capabilities and requisite compute budgets. At the moment, the most popular chat model in the world is [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), a fine-tuned and wrapped version of [the GPT4 decoder model hosted by OpenAI](https://openai.com/gpt-4). This model is not open-source and its internals are not generally-accessible; rather, it is hosted in the cloud and users are able to access it over a web-based API. This offers some key benefits for the average consumer, since they do not have to worry about scraping together the necessary compute in order to run the model. On the other hand, it's a sizeable issue for large companies or those who want to use their own clusters due to legal restrictions or privacy concerns. It's also not that great if you already have sufficient hardware on-hand, since the service does come with a price tag that can scale greatly for even moderate-traffic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we will be using a state-of-the-art open-sourced model called [Llama-2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), released by Meta in July 2023. We will specifically be focusing in on the chat-tuned flavors like [Llaba-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf), which have been fine-tuned for chat applications and is ready to run out of the box!\n",

As a real-use-case SOTA LLM model, Llama-2 comes in three main size configurations: [7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)-, [13B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)-, and [70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf)-parameter architectures. Despite so many options, all of these models are an order of magnitude larger than the models we've been using so far, and in fact will fail to run with many consumer-level GPU compute budgets if loaded in naively.

    "#### **Quantization: A Primer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization is the process of constraining an input from a large set to output in a smaller set. In the case of floating values, it means transitioning from a higher-precision representation (i.e. 32-bit floating point values) to a lower precision (i.e. 16/8/4-bit) of the internals to save on computation time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of neural networks, it primarily involves reducing the precision of the numbers representing the model's parameters. This process can significantly reduce the computational needs and memory footprint to make large models more accessible for inference, but will usually come with a cost of reduced (or at least shifted) performance properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Several Quantization Techniques Include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Standard integer quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/quantization).\n",
    "    - Standard integer quantization with some flavors like mixed-precision or selective options. This generally lead to light-to-severe degradation depending on options and whether [Quantization-Aware Training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/tensorflow-quantization-toolkit/docs/docs/qat.html) was used. \n",
    "    - Model does have to be loaded into local memory, but forward pass with unquantized model not necessary.\n",
    "    - In HuggingFace, this is supported by [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) and [`accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) via `BitsAndBytesConfig` or simply the `load_in_8bit/load_in_4bit` flags.\n",
    "- [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) integer quantization optimized for typical use.\n",
    "    - Improves quantization performance by adapting rounding to perserve semantics of typical input data.\n",
    "    - Requires forward passes through the network, meaning system must at least support unquantized model forward pass.\n",
    "    - In HuggingFace, this is supported by [`AutoGPTQ`](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ) and [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the theory and practical intuitions, [this Deci blog post on Quantization and Quantization-Aware Training](https://deci.ai/quantization-and-quantization-aware-training/) is a good entry point! A problem with using this, however, is that you do need sufficient storage capacity to load in and quantize the model on your end, which can be quite an ask for consumer systems:\n",
    "- Llama-2-70B contains 70 billion parameters and takes up roughly ~135GB.\n",
    "- The 8-bit quantization is ~69GB, and the conversion does not delete the original from memory. \n",
    "- The GPU has to be utilized to facilitate this conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result:**\n",
    "- A100s or greater generally required to run Llama-2-70B without quantization, or to GPTQ-quantize the model yourself. \n",
    "- A100 generally required to quantize and run Llama-2-70B-8qt yourself.\n",
    "- A lower-spec-but-fully-utilized A10 or T4 required to quantize and run Llama-2-13B-4qt and lower.\n",

One such group that pre-quantizes large models is the [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) group, which frequently uploads large fine-tuned models that can be ran locally. One such example is ([TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ), is quick to load in and has sufficient performance capabilities for the purposes of this notebook!"
