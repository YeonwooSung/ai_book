    "  1. It should maintain a conversation buffer to remember what's happened so far.\n",
    "     - It should **at least** keep track of the speaker's name and who they are... \n",
    "     - Can be done with standard buffers, entity buffers, variables, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. If the message contains an image link, the agent \"looks at\" the image and responds appropriately. \n",
    "     - Assume images provided as ``` `<path/to/img>.[png/jpg/jpeg]` ```\n",
    "     - Python tip, you can find and replace entries of ```last_obs.split('`')```. No regex required!\n",
    "  3. If the message contains the substring ` ``` `, the agent will generate and return code.\n",
    "     - Do not include ` ``` ` in the output; feel free to replace it if it pops out at the end. \n",
    "     - Recall priming the network post-instruction and then post-processing the output!\n",
    "\n",
    "**State-Tracking Features:**\n",
    "Feel free to modify the agent behavior for exceptional values. Feel free to use non-commercially-viable options, but be concious.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. It should track the toxicity of the user's most recent correspondance, stored in the state variable `user_toxicity`.\n",
    "      - This can be useful for all kinds of stuff (while tracking both the user and llm), including guardrailing, tracking, swapping to live human, data acquisition filtering, etc.\n",
    "  5. For every message, it should track the user's most-likely emotional state, stored in the state variable `user_emotion` as a string.\n",
    "      - This can be quite useful for modulating the tone and making pre-determined tweaks to the system messaging/instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- **Harder Option (Good option for last feature if you have enough time and feel comfortable):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. If the user wants to talk about deep learning, the agent can load in the PDF of [the Dive into Deep Learning Textbook (PyTorch Version)](d2l.ai/) and pull informatiom from it.\n",
    "      - Advanced use-case. See [72_llama_index.ipynb](72_llama_index.ipynb) for example, and the challenge then is to [make it work with LangChain like so](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/integrations/using_with_langchain.html). -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIPS:** \n",
    "- Go for the easiest ones first, or the ones you feel most confident about.\n",
    "- When possible, limit the amount of generation and/or use simple models. \n",
    "- This assignment can be done without pulling in other Huggingface models, but we do want you to use some and already pre-loaded a selection for you.\n",
    "- When pulling in HuggingFace models, remember that they are great for inspiration, but some might have restricted dataset licenses and might not be deployable in a commercial system. \n",
    "- Perhaps [`extras_and_licenses/99_licenses.ipynb`](extras_and_licenses/99_licenses.ipynb) might be of use?\n",
